Installing Gwibber
==================

  Requirements
  ------------

	Please note that the version numbers listed below only reflect my test
	environment. Gwibber is known to work with those specific versions, but
	will probably work fine on most current desktop distributions that include
	Python's WebKit GTK+ bindings.

    * python (2.5)
    * python-dbus (0.80.2)
    * python-gtk2 (2.10.4)
    * python-gconf (2.18.0)
    * python-imaging (1.1.6)
    * python-notify (0.1.1)
    * python-webkitgtk (1.0.1)
    * python-simplejson (1.9.1)
    * python-egenix-mxdatetime (3.0.0)
    * python-distutils-extra
    * python-feedparser (4.1)
    * python-xdg (0.15)
    * python-mako (0.2.2)
    * python-pycurl

  Installation
  ------------

	Gwibber uses Python's distutils framework for installation. In order to
	install Gwibber, you will need root access. To install Gwibber, perform
	the following command as root:

      $ python setup.py install

  Run Gwibber
  -----------

	If you installed Gwibber using the setup.py script, you can launch the
	program by typing "gwibber" at the command line. If you want to run
	Gwibber without installing it, start "bin/gwibber" from within the
	Gwibber directory.
